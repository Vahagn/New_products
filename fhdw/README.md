<h1>Full High-definition Website (FHDW) - 04/17/2018</h1>

Full High-definition Website (FHDW) is a new product and the goal is to adjust the size of a web page into the resolution of all existing devices.<br>
- I think you familiar with FHD or Full HD concept: 1080p (1920x1080px; also known as Full HD or FHD and BT.709) is a... read more.<br>
As we see the resolution of FHD is 1920x1080px, while in FHDW the resolution is not only 1920x1080px, but the resolution of the current device, for example, if the screen resolution of any device is 3200x1800px or 7680x4320px ... 10 000px with an appropriate height, 100 000px, 1 000 000px, even endless (I think it will work, if technology will give that kind resolution) the FHDW will adjust the sizes of a web page into these screen resolutions.<br>
How to know or how to validate that a website is FHDW?<br>
It's very simple, just zoom in on the website, if the sizes (in the visual) of the content of a website don't change, it means the website is Full High-definition Website (FHDW) otherwise it's not.<br>

Advantages:<br>
&ensp;The screen resolution is no longer a problem (even endless, if technology will give that kind resolution).<br>
&ensp;No extra framework.<br>
<h2>The history of creating FHDW</h2>
When I made my old website, screen resolution supports <= 1366тип768px. When the first time I saw the website on a high-definition screen (the same result is when zooming in), it looked small, and some parts of a "body" (it depends on the resolution) were also visible, which I didn't want (try on any website).<br>

I decided to use a some software or framework that should solves this problem, but unfortunately I couldn't find. So I decided to do myself, since I didn't have enough knowledge, this issue was open.<br>

But today this issue is solved thanks to FHDW and the most important thing is that I do NOT use any extra software or framework.
Technologies used - CSS, JavaScript or jQuery, Web API.<br>
