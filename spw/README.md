<h1>Sole Page Website (SPW) - 04/17/2018</h1>

Sole Page Website (SPW) is a new product and the goal is to reduce the pages of a website to a single one, a one page, a one file website and NOT like scrolling one page website.<br>
And how to know or how to validate that website is SPW or not?<br>
It's very simple, In Sole Page Website (SPW) when clicking a button (nav), it navigates and doesn't scroll, even if reloading the page. In scrolling one page website, it scrolls down and doesn't navigate, that's the main difference. Besides in the address bar (URL bar) of a browser must be only domain name or domain name immediately followed slash sign (/), number sign (#) and word characters (\w, can be special characters such as *, ^ etc.) or slash sign (/), question sign (?), word characters (\w, can be special characters such as *, ^ etc.), equal sign (=) and word characters (\w, can be special characters such as *, ^ etc.), for example, "www.domain_name/#example" or "www.domain_name/?example=any_example".<br>

&ensp;Less code.<br>
&ensp;Less code less bug.<br>

<h2>The history of creating SPW</h2>
When the first time I started to code (in web programming), I made web pages for each single image. Of course, this is a very bad practice, but as I didnâ€™t know enough knowledge, I had no choice. As soon as I realized that it was possible to have a one page, a one file website, the idea of the SPW was born.<br>
